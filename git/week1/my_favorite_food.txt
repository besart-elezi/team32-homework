Sure! Here’s a simple and delicious recipe using walnuts and honey. It’s perfect for a snack or a sweet topping for yogurt, oatmeal, or desserts.

### Honey Roasted Walnuts

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup walnut halves
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp olive oil (or melted butter)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional, but adds a nice touch)
- Pinch of sea salt (optional)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional, for extra flavor)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Prepare the walnuts**: In a mixing bowl, combine the walnut halves with olive oil (or melted butter) and honey. Toss well to coat the walnuts evenly.

3. **Add flavorings**: If you’re using cinnamon and vanilla extract, stir them in now. A pinch of sea salt is a nice contrast to the sweetness, so feel free to add it if you like.

4. **Spread on a baking sheet**: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Spread the walnuts in a single layer on the sheet.

5. **Roast**: Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, stirring once halfway through to ensure they roast evenly. Keep a close eye on them after the 10-minute mark, as they can burn quickly.

6. **Cool and serve**: Once they’re golden brown and fragrant, remove from the oven. Let them cool on the baking sheet. The honey will harden slightly as it cools, giving the walnuts a nice sticky glaze.

7. **Enjoy**! You can eat these as a snack, sprinkle them over salads, yogurt, oatmeal, or even use them as a topping for baked goods.
