**A Journey Through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Germany**

My journey took me to three amazing countries: **Saudi Arabia**, **Turkey**, and **Germany**. Each country was very different, but all were filled with wonderful experiences that I will never forget.

### **Saudi Arabia: A Spiritual Journey**

I started my trip in **Saudi Arabia**, a country with a rich history and culture. The most special part of my visit was going to **Makkah** and **Medina**. In Makkah, I had the chance to visit the **Kaaba** in the **Masjid al-Haram**, the holiest site in Islam. The feeling of being surrounded by so many people all praying together was very powerful. In **Medina**, I visited the **Prophet’s Mosque**, where the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is buried. It was a peaceful and spiritual place, and I felt a deep connection to the history of the city.

### **Turkey: A Blend of East and West**

Next, I traveled to **Turkey**, a country that mixes the cultures of Europe and Asia. I started in **Istanbul**, where I saw the beautiful **Hagia Sophia** and the **Blue Mosque**. Walking through the **Grand Bazaar**, I found colorful shops full of spices, carpets, and sweets. I also visited **Cappadocia**, where I saw strange rock formations and even rode in a hot air balloon at sunrise. The view was incredible! In **Ephesus**, I explored ancient ruins that were once home to a great Roman city.

### **Germany: A Mix of History and Modern Life**

My last stop was **Germany**. In **Berlin**, I visited the **Berlin Wall**, a symbol of the country’s history of division and unity. I also went to **Munich**, where I enjoyed **Oktoberfest**, tasting delicious food and joining the celebrations. My favorite part was visiting **Neuschwanstein Castle**, which looked like a fairy tale with its tall towers and beautiful views of the mountains.

### **Reflecting on the Trip**

This trip was full of new experiences and lessons. In **Saudi Arabia**, I felt a deep sense of spirituality. In **Turkey**, I enjoyed the mix of old and new, with its rich history and unique landscapes. In **Germany**, I learned about both the past and the future, with its history and modern innovations. I am grateful for the chance to explore these amazing places and meet so many kind people along the way.
