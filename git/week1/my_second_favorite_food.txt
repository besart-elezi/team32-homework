### Baked Fish with Roasted Vegetables

#### Ingredients:
- **For the Fish:**
  - 4 white fish fillets (such as cod, haddock, or tilapia)
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 lemon (zested and juiced)
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 tsp dried oregano (or fresh, if you have it)
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (optional, for a smoky flavor)

- **For the Roasted Vegetables:**
  - 2 medium zucchinis, sliced into rounds
  - 1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
  - 1 small red onion, cut into wedges
  - 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
  - 1-2 carrots, sliced
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tsp dried thyme or rosemary (or a mix of both)
  - Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven**: Heat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Prepare the vegetables**: In a large mixing bowl, toss the zucchini, bell pepper, onion, cherry tomatoes, and carrots with olive oil, thyme (or rosemary), salt, and pepper. Spread the vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until they’re tender and slightly browned.

3. **Prepare the fish**: While the veggies roast, place the fish fillets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle the fillets with olive oil, and then sprinkle with lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and pepper. Squeeze the juice of half the lemon over the fish.

4. **Bake the fish**: When the veggies have about 10 minutes left to cook, put the fish in the oven and bake for 8-12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. The fish should be opaque and flake easily with a fork.

5. **Serve**: Once everything is done, plate the fish alongside the roasted vegetables. Squeeze the remaining lemon half over the top for a fresh citrus finish.

6. **Optional**: Garnish with fresh parsley or basil for a pop of color and flavor.
